It covers all topics in the field of neural networks from biological neural network modeling to artificial neural computation.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">FUZZ-IEEE The annual IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE) is the foremost conference in the field of fuzzy systems. It covers all topics in fuzzy systems from theory to applications.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">IEEE CEC The annual IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC) is one of the leading events in the field of evolutionary computation. It covers all topics in evolutionary computation from theory to applications.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px;">All papers should be submitted electronically through the Congress website. Contributed papers will be refereed by experts in the fields based on the criteria of originality, significance, quality and clarity.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><br>Call for Tutorials<br></span><br></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">IEEE WCCI 2014 will feature pre-Congress tutorials, covering fundamental and advanced topics in computational intelligence. A tutorial proposal should include title, outline, expected enrolment, and presenter/organizer biography. Inquiries regarding the tutorials should be addressed to Tutorials Chairs.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>Call for Special Session Proposals<br><br></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">IEEE WCCI 2016 solicits proposals for special sessions within the technical scope of the three conferences. Special sessions, to be organized by internationally recognized experts, aim to bring together researchers in special focused topics. Cross-fertilization of the three technical disciplines and newly emerging research areas are strongly encouraged. Papers submitted for special sessions are to be peer-reviewed with the same criteria used for the contributed papers.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>Call for Competition Proposals<br><br></span><span style="font-size: 16px;">IEEE WCCI 2016 will host competitions to stimulate research in computational intelligence, promote fair evaluations, and attract students. The proposals should include descriptions of the problems addressed, motivations and expected impact on computational intelligence, data description, evaluation procedures and established baselines, schedules, anticipated number of participants, and a biography of the main team members.</span><br>
