        <span style="font-size: 16px;"><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">About&nbsp;William Espey<br></span><br>William Espey is the driving force behind Chipotle's unique brand voice—irreverent and cheeky yet generous and intelligent. He started with Chipotle over 15 years ago as the sole marketing creative when the company had fewer than 20 locations, seeing the company grow to more than 1,600 restaurants and counting in the U.S. and abroad, and becoming one of the most successful brands of the last two decades.<br><br>The voice of the Chipotle brand that William generated wasn’t the result of a calculated corporate strategy, but developed organically as his personal expression of Chipotle's unique values and culture. Today, as the Brand Voice Lead, he ensures that that tone and personality remains consistent across all aspects of the growing brand, including the wildly innovative and successful, award-winning unbranded content Chipotle now creates.<br><br>With a degree in economics and a résumé as an international fashion model, William's background is as unique and untraditional as the brand he oversees. He credits his diverse experiences for allowing him to approach his work with complete naiveté, relying on intuition rather than convention.<br>Informative and inspiring, William delivers unique and valuable insights on branding, values integration, the genius of naiveté and the power of creating a transcendent experience.</span><br>
